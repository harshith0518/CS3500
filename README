xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".

To run the image [to create the container] in powershell:
        docker run -it -v "C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\xv6-riscv:/home/os-iitm/xv6-riscv" svkv/riscv-tools:v1.0


To remove all of the containers of an image: 
        docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=id_of_the_image" -q | ForEach-Object { docker rm -f $_ }
